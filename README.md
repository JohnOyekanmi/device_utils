```

## Usage

### Import the package
```dart
import 'package:device_utils/device_utils.dart';
import 'package:device_utils/models/system_apps.dart';
```

### Get Installed Applications
```dart
// Get all installed apps with icons
final apps = await DeviceUtils.getInstalledApps(
  appType: AppType.all,  // Options: all, system, user
  includeIcons: true,    // Whether to include app icons
);
```

### Launch System Applications
```dart
// Open calendar
await DeviceUtils.openSystemApp(SystemApps.calendar);

// Open camera
await DeviceUtils.openSystemApp(SystemApps.camera);

// Open clock
await DeviceUtils.openSystemApp(SystemApps.clock);

// Open phone
await DeviceUtils.openSystemApp(SystemApps.phone);

// Open settings
await DeviceUtils.openSystemApp(SystemApps.settings);
```

### Launch Specific Application
```dart
// Launch an app using its package name
await DeviceUtils.launchApp('com.example.package');
```

### Open App Settings
```dart
// Open settings for a specific app
await DeviceUtils.openAppSettings('com.example.package');
```
